# LAPD-Crime
Cleaned LAPD crime data in Python and visualized it in Tableau Desktop to gather insights on things like:<br>
- What places are most dangerous?
- What race, gender, and age group are most targeted?

## Cleaned and organized a messy table with over 925,000 rows in a Jupyter Notebook using Visual Studio Code and writing Python.
  - Each observation (row) was a unique crime with associated data
  - I took the last 4 years of data
  - Data was cleaned, grouped, sorted, and filtered into a usable data frame that I could use in Tableau

## Further manipulated the data to create a dashboard in Tableau Desktop
  - Joined the cleaned data with an LAPD division shapefile
  - Created charts to visualize the data including:
    - Map
    - Histogram
    - Bubble Charts
    - Treemaps
    - Donut Chart
  - Combined charts to create an interactive dashboard filtered by user selection<br>

- Data was provided by the Los Angeles Police Department [here](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data)
- Raw csv and cleaned excel file were too large to add to a github repository
